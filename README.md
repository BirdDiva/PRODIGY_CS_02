# Task 2

The task is to develop a simple image encryption tool using pixel manipulation. You can perform operations like swapping pixel values or applying a basic mathematical operation to each pixel. Allow users to encrypt and decrypt images.

It will create an encrypted image (“encrypted_image.png”) and a decrypted image (“decrypted_image.png”) for the given original image.
